Hundreds of thousands of Veterans have waited more than three years for a final disability claim appeal decision, relying on a complex and duplicative process. A comprehensive solution requires Congress to act and the Administration has called on them to do just that, but we are also doing what we can in the meantime. With the Board of Veterans&#8217; Appeals, we launched Caseflow Certification, a simple web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added before an appeal can move forward. This simple check helps reduce preventable errors and avoidable delays caused by disjointed, manual processing.
